## About The App

This is a FlashCard Generator app which have been created mainly using Reactjs. 
So, what is a Flashcard?

This app has three pages:
1.	Create Flashcard Page
2.	My Flashcard Page
3.	Flashcard Details Page

Create Flashcard Page: This is the homepage of the app where flashcards are created using input boxes provided by Formix.

My Flashcard Page: This page shows the list of flashcard groups created in the Create page.

Flashcard Details Page: In this page there is a full detail of the cards created earlier with share link, print option and download button.
